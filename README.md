CoffeeScriptNotebook
====================

Quick experiment: How hard can it be to make interactive CoffeeScript with a notebook interface 
similar to [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) or [IPython notebook](ipython.org/notebook.html)?
This runs completely inside the browser and has almost no functionality beyond adding and evaluating CoffeeScript.

See the IPython pull request https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/5130 for something similar that runs on top of 
IPython notebook.
